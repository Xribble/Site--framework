          but has knowledge and capabilities that are equivalent to that of an experienced junior Python Developer.
          I boast such capabilities and if you have any exciting ideas then you can contact me through any one of my social handles.</p>

        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
        <p>I have a solid background in data interpretation, statistical analysis, and data visualization as a junior data analysis intern.
