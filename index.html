        <h3> Junior Python Developer.</h3>
        <p>I started python 6 years ago, in my schooldays. Now, we live in the era of MOOCs, GSocers, Kagglers, just to name a few.
          And it is not uncommon to find an entry level Python developer who has never worked for anyone,
          but has knowledge and capabilities that are equivalent to that of an experienced junior Python Developer.
          I boast such capabilities and if you have any exciting ideas then you can contact me through any one of my social handles.</p>
